# Morkovka ♥️ React

Welcome to better React setup! We've got everything remade for you to explore React.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with the what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one repository. You have your repository (one that you are editing now) on GitHub.

This project was bootstrapped for you with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
